# KrinikCam — context for AI agents (universal fallback)

This project is wrapped by the **KAIF 1.4** framework (see `KAIF_FRAMEWORK.md`). The canon is NOT
duplicated here — read the sources:

1. **`AGENT_GUIDE.md`** — THE canon: rules, names, commands, conventions (+context router: which doc
   slice to read per task type). Read before every task.
2. **`STATUS.md`** — the living state: what's done, where we are, what's next.
3. **`PHILOSOPHY.md`** — the core principle: SIMPLICITY (KISS + Occam). Stuck = you misunderstood the
   task → simplify.
4. **`BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`** — how to fix defects (fix→build→test loop, the 3-attempts rule).
5. **`EXPERIENCE.md`** — the agent's lesson log: recall (grep by tag) before a task, capture after a
   meaningful success/failure (skill `/experience`).
6. Maps: `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md` (where things are) and
   `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_INTERNAL_MAP.md` (how it works).

Knowledge directories: `plans/` `ideas/` `bugs/` `researches/` `interviews/` `homeworks/` — each has a
README with its rules. Closed items get the `DONE` tag in the filename.

Skills (Claude Code format, `.claude/skills/`; other agents: treat each SKILL.md as a named procedure):
`/resume` `/pause` `/autoloop` `/dayloop` `/nightloop` `/refresh-context` `/check-backlog`
`/report-bug` `/bug-research` `/propose-idea` `/experience` `/interview` `/revision` `/help-kaif` `/release`
`/kaif-version` `/kaif-update` `/kaif-fork` `/kaif-switch-origin` `/kaif-remove`.

Working language of the project docs: Russian. The owner is Krinik (Mikalai Kryvusha).
